Static code analysis and metrics
==========================

On the topic of good and clean code we try to understand if code quality can be measured and visualized. What kind of software metrics are usable and what are they saying about the software. How should we work with validation tools to enhance the perceived quality of our software.

There will be a recorded lecture covering the topic.

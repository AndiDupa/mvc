Framework test
==========================

The proposed way to test out these frameworks are to copy them all to you `me/frameworks-test/` directory and use them from there.

```
# Go to the root of the course repo
rsync -av example/framework/ me/framework-test/
cd me/framework-test
```

Each directory contains the instructions on how to get going with each framework.

Do remember to update each `.htaccess` and replace 'mosstud' with your own acronym.

Write your own class in Symfony
==========================

This exercise will show you how to create and use your own classes in a Symfony controller. The exampla code is built around [the dice game 100](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_(dice_game)).

There is working code for controllers and template files which you can copy to your own website and see how it works. Use the code examples to understand how you could write your own code.
